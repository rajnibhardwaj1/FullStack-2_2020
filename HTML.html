    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext
        refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage
        is called Hypertext.As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up"
        a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.Originally, HTML was developed
        with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to
        facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.Now, HTML is being widely used to format
        web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.HTML is the language for publishing web
        pages on the WWW (World-Wide Web).HTML is a Document Description Language (aka Document Markup Language). HTML
        is NOT a programming language like C/C++/C#/Java, which is used to implement programming algorithm.You need a
        web browser to view the HTML pages. The web browsers do not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to
        interpret the content of the web pages.An HTML document is a text document.
