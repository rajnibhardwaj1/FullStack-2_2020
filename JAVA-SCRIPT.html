    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.The programs in this language are called scripts. They
        can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.Scripts are provided and
        executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect, JavaScript is
        very different from another language called Java.Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
        provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require
        it.JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports
        functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc. In-browser
        JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.</p>
