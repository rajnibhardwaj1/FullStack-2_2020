    <p>It is an open-source and free framework of CSS which helps in directing a responsive device friendly mobile first
        front-end webpage development tool. Bootstrap includes the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and an optional
        JavaScript supported design template (plug-ins) that deals with typography, implementation of buttons, forms and
        various other components for the user interface. This framework helps in faster web development and support
        developers in creating responsive web pages at a quicker pace. Develop a webpage which can make it comfortable
        in various sized devices (such as mobile phones, tablets, and
        desktop screens) will help developers to make a single webpage that can be seen on different devices, hence
        reducing the effort of measuring different sized devices and then making individual pages for each of them. In
        this tutorial series, you will learn about the Bootstrap and its various features.</p>
